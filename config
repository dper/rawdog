# The maximum number of articles to show. 0 for no limit.
maxarticles 200

# The maximum age of articles to show. 0 for no limit.
maxage 0

# The age after which articles will be discarded if they do not appear
# in a feed. Set this to a larger value to cover more days.
expireage 1d

# The minimum number of articles from each feed to keep around in the history.
# Set this to 0 to only keep articles that were returned the last time the feed
# was fetched. (If this is set to 0, or "currentonly" below is set to true,
# then rawdog will not send the RFC3229+feed "A-IM: feed" header when making
# HTTP requests, since it can't tell from the response to such a request
# whether any articles have been removed from the feed; this makes rawdog
# slightly less bandwidth-efficient.)
keepmin 20

# Only display articles that are currently included in a feed.
currentonly false

# Divide the articles up by day with a heading.
daysections true

# Whether to divide the articles up by time with a heading.

# Whether to show the list of active feeds in the generated HTML.
# available.)
showfeeds true

# The time that rawdog will wait before considering a feed unreachable.
timeout 30s

# Whether to silenty ignore timeouts.
ignoretimeouts false

# Whether to show Python traceback messages. If this is true, rawdog will show
# a traceback message if an exception is thrown while fetching a feed.
showtracebacks false

# Whether the articles displayed are sorted first by the date in the feed.
sortbyfeeddate false

# The fields to use when detecting duplicate articles: "id" is the article's
# unique ID or GUID; "link" is the article's link. rawdog will find the first
# one of these that's present in the article, and ignore the article if it's
# seen an article before (in any feed) that had the same value.  For example,
# specifying "hideduplicates id link" will first look for id/guid, then for
# link.
# Note that some feeds use the same link for all their articles; if you specify
# "link" here, you will probably want to specify the "allowduplicates" feed
# argument (see below) for those feeds.
hideduplicates id

# The feeds you want to watch, in the format "feed period url [args]".
# The period is the minimum time between updates. An interval less than
# 30 minutes is considered bad manners. Where reasonable, longer is nicer.
#
# Possible arguments are:
# id                  Value for the __feed_id__ value in the item
#                     template for items in this feed (defaults to the
#                     feed title with non-alphanumeric characters and
#                     HTML markup removed)
# user                User for HTTP basic authentication
# password            Password for HTTP basic authentication
# format              "text" to indicate that the descriptions in this feed
#                     are unescaped plain text (rather than the usual HTML),
#                     and should be escaped and wrapped in a <pre> element
# X_proxy             Proxy URL for protocol X (for instance, "http_proxy")
# proxyuser           User for proxy basic authentication
# proxypassword       Password for proxy basic authentication
# allowduplicates     "true" to disable duplicate detection for this feed
# maxage              Override the global "maxage" value for this feed
# keepmin             Override the global "keepmin" value for this feed
# define_X            Equivalent to "define X ..." for item templates
#                     when displaying items from this feed
# You can provide a default set of arguments for all feeds using
